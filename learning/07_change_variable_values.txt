change variable values

if we assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:

int myNum = 15; //myNum is 15
myNum = 10; //myNum is now 10

we can also assign the value of one variable to another:

ex. 
int myNum = 15;
int myOtherNum = 23; 

//assign the value of myOtherNum (23) to myNum 
myNum = myOtherNum;

//myNum is now 23, instead of 15
printf("%d", myNum);

or copy values to empty variables:

// Create a variable and assign the value 15 to it
int myNum = 15;

// Declare a variable without assigning it a value
int myOtherNum;

// Assign the value of myNum to myOtherNum
myOtherNum = myNum;

// myOtherNum now has 15 as a value
printf("%d", myOtherNum);

add variables together
to add a variable to another variable, we use the + operator:

int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int sum = x + y;
printf("%d", sum);
