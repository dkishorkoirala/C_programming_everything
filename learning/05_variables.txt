C variables
variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters.

in C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), 
- int : stores integers(whole number) without decimal values from -infinity to +infinity
- float : stores floating point numbers, with decimal values from -infinity to +infinity
-char: stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'A' characters are surrounded by single quotes

Declaring (creating) a variable
to create a variable without assigning a value , and  assign the value later:

ex.
//declaring variable
int myNum;

//assign a value to the variable
myNum = 15;

output variables:
printf() function prints text we learned earlier

if we :
int myNum = 15;
printf(myNum); // nothing happens

to output variables in C, you must get familiar with somthing called " format specifiers "
