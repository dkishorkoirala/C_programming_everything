The char type

the char data type is used to store a single character.

the character must be surrounded by single quotes like 'a' or 'C' and we use the %c 
format specifier to print it.

ex.
char myGrade = 'A';
printf("%c", myGrade);

alternatively, ,if you are familar with ASCII, you can use ASCII values to display certain 
characters, note that these values are not surrounded by quotes(' ') as they are numbers;

char a = 65, b = 66, c = 67;

printf("%c %c %c", a, b, c);

tip: A list oof all ASCII values can be found in ASCII reference table

Notes on characters
if we try to store more than a single character, it will only print the last character:
ex.
char myText = 'Hello';
printf("%c", myText);

Note: Don't use the char type for storing multiple character, as it may produce errors.

To store multiple characters( or whole word), use strings(which we will learn more about in a later):
char myText[] = "Hello";
printf("%s", myText);

we use string for storing multiple characters/text, and the char type for single characters.
