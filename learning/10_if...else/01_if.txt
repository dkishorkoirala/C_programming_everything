conditions and if statements:

we know that c supports familiar comparision condtitions from mathematics, such as:
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
Equal to a == b
Not Equal to: a != b

we can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions
c has the following conditional statements:

- use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specidied condition is true
- use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- use switch to specify many alternative block of code to be executed

the if statement

use the if statement to specify a block of code to be executed if a condtion is true

if (condtion){
    //statement executed if the condtion is true
}

note that if is in lowercase. uppercase letter (if or IF) will generate an error

in the example below, we test two value to find out if 20 is greater than 18. if the 
condition is true, print some text:

example
if (20 > 18){
    printf("20 is greater than 18");
}

we can also test variables:

int x = 20;
int y = 18;
if (x > y){
    printf("X is greater than y");
}

in this example above we use two variables, x and y to test whether x is greater than y (using the > operator)
as x is 20, and y is 18, and we know that 20 is greater than 18, we print to the 
screen that "x is greater than y"
