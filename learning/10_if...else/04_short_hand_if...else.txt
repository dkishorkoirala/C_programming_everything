Short Hand if....else (ternary operator)

there is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator
because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code
with a single line. It is often used to replace if else statements:

syntax:
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;

instead of writing:
ex:
int time = 20;
if (time < 18) {
  printf("Good day.");
} else {
  printf("Good evening.");
}

we can simply wrote"

int time = 20;
(time < 18) ? printf("Good day.") : printf("Good evening.");
