The else if statement

use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

syntax:
if (condition1){
    //block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else if (condition2){
    //block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    //block of code to be executed if the condition1 and condition2 are false
}

ex:

int time = 22;
if (time < 10){
    printf("Good morning.");
} else if (time < 20){
    printf("Good day.");
} else {
    printf("Good evening.");
}
// output Good evening

example explained:
in the example above, time (22) is greater than 10, so the first condition is false
the next condition in the else if statement, is also false, so we move on to the else 
condition since condition 1 and condition2 is both false - and print to the 
screen "Good evening"

however, if the time was 14, our porgram would print "Good day"
