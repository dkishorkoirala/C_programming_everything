Real life example:

let's think of a "real life example" where we need to find out if a person is old enough to vote.

int myAge = 25;
int votingAge = 18;

printf("%d", myAge >= votingAge); // Returns 1 (true), meaning 25 year olds are allowed to vote!

better version:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int myAge = 25;
    int votingAge = 18;

    if (myAge >= votingAge) {
        printf("You are old enough to vote!");
    } else {
        printf("You are not old enough to vote!");
    }
    return 0;
}
