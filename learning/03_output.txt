Output (Print Text)
to output values or print text in c , we use the printf() function:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
}

Double quotes (" ")
must be wrapped with Double quotes (" ")

we can use as much as printf() as we want
however, note that it doesnot insert a new line at the end of the output

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  printf("I am learning C.");
  printf("And it is awesome!");
  return 0;
}

output:
Hello World!I am learning C.And it is awesome!

new-line:
to insert new line we use "\n" character

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  printf("I am learning C.");
  return 0;
}

output:
Hello World!
I am learning C.

we can also output multiple line with a single printf() function as

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!\nI am learning C.\nAnd it is awesome!");
  return 0;
}

output:
Hello World!
I am learning C.
And it is awesome!

tips:
two \n character after each other will create a blank line:
ex.
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!\n\n");
  printf("I am learning C.");
  return 0;
}

output:
Hello World!

I am learning C.

NOTE: these \n character is called "escape sequence"
other escape sequence are \t (horizontal tab), \\ (insert backslash), \r (return), 
\a (alert) and \" (insert double quotes)
