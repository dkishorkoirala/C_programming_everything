C Variable Names

all c variables must be identified with unique names.
these unique name are called identifiers.

identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more discriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

Note:
recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code.

ex. 
int minutesPerHour = 60;
// ok, but not so easy to understand with m actually is 
int m = 60;

the general rules for naming variables are:

- names can contain letters, digits and underscores
- names must start with a letter or underscore(_)
- name are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
- names cannot contain whitespace or special characters like !, #, % etc
- reserved words (Such as int) cannot be used as names
