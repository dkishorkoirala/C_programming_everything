Real-life example

we often use simplified variable names to match their data types
(myInt or myNum for int types, myChar for char types and so on).
this is done to avoid confusion

however, for a practical example of using variables, we have created a program
that stores different data about a college student:

ex.
// Student data
int studentID = 15;
int studentAge = 23;
float studentFee = 75.25;
char studentGrade = 'B';

// Print variables
printf("Student id: %d\n", studentID);
printf("Student age: %d\n", studentAge);
printf("Student fee: %f\n", studentFee);
printf("Student grade: %c", studentGrade);

calculate the area of a rectangle:

int length = 4, width = 6, area;

area = length * width;

printf("length is %d\n", length);
printf("width is %d\n", width);
printf("Area of the rectangle is %d\n",area);
