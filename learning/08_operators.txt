Operators

operators are used to perform operations on variables and values

+ operators 
int myNum = 100 + 50;

although the + operator is often used to add together two values,
it can also be used to add together a variable and a value or a variable and another variable

ex.
int sum1 = 100 + 50;
int sum2 = sum1 + 25;
int sum3 = sum1 + sum2;

c divides the operator into the following groups:
- arithmetic operators
- assignment operators
- comparison operators
- logical operators
- bitwise operators

arithmetic operators
operator    name       description                     example
+           addition    adds together two values        x + y
-           subtraction subtracts one value from another x - y
*           multiplication multiplies two values       x * y
/           division    divides one value by another    x / y
%           modulus     returns the division remainder x % y 
++          increment   increments a variable by one     ++x
--          decrement   decrements a variable by one     --x

Assignment operators
assignment operators are used to assign values to variables

we use the assignment operators (=) to assign the value t10 to a variable called x

int x = 10;

the addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable

int x = 10;
x += 5;

a list of all assignment operators:
Operator	Example	    Same As	
=	        x = 5	    x = 5	
+=	        x += 3	    x = x + 3	
-=	        x -= 3	    x = x - 3	
*=	        x *= 3	    x = x * 3	
/=	        x /= 3	    x = x / 3	
%=	        x %= 3	    x = x % 3	
&=	        x &= 3	    x = x & 3	
|=	        x |= 3	    x = x | 3	
^=	        x ^= 3	    x = x ^ 3	
>>=	        x >>= 3	    x = x >> 3	
<<=	        x <<= 3	    x = x << 3	

comparision operators
comparision operators are used to compare two values (or variable) this is 
important in programming because it helps us to find answers and make decisions

the return value of a comparison is either true or false (1 or 0) these values
are known as boolean value and we will learn more about them later

in the following ex: we use the greater than operator (> ) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

int x = 5;
int y = 3;
printf("%d", x > y);


list of all comparision operators:

operator            name                        description                                 example 
==                  equal                       checks if two values are equal              x == y
!=                  not equal                   checks if two values are not equal          x != y
>                   greater than                checks if x is greater than y               x > y
<                   less than                   checks if x is less than y                  x < y
>=                  greater than or equal to    checks if x is greater than or equal to y   x >= y
<=                  less than or equal to       checks if x is less than or equal to y      x <= y

Logical operators
we can also test for true or false values with logical operators

logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values, by combining multiple conditions:

operator            name        example         description
&&                  and         x && y          returns true if both x and y are true
||                  or          x || y          returns true if one of x or y is true
!                   not         !x              returns true if x is not true
