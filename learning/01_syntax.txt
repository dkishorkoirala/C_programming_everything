#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
}

#include <stdio.h> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions, 
such as printf() (used in line 4). Header files add functionality to C programs.

A blank line. C ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.

Another thing that always appear in a C program is main(). This is called a function. 
Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.

printf() -> function used to output/print text to the screen here hello World

Note: every statement ends with ; "semi-colon"

retrun 0 indicates the end of the program
