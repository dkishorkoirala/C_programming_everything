Comments 
they are used to explain code, to make it more readable and 
, to prevent execution when testing alternative code

two types:
- single line
- multi-line

single line starts with // 
ex. 
//this is comment 
printf("Hello World!");

printf("Hello World!"); //this is a comment used at the end of the line

C- multi-line comments:
multi-line comments start with /* and end with */
any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler

/* The code below will print the words Hello World!
to the screen, and it is amazing */
printf("Hello World!");
