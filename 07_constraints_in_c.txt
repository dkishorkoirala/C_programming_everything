Constants 

if you don't want other (or yourself) to change existing values, we can use const keyword
this will declare the variable as "Constant", which means Unchangeable and read-only

ex:
const int myNum = 15;
myNum = 10; // will result in an error

we should always declare the variable as constant whe we have values that are unlikely 
to change:

ex:
const int minutesPerHour = 60;

Notes on constants

when we declare a constant variable, it must be assigned with a value:
ex:
like this:
const int minutesPerHour = 60;

//this however will not work
const int minutesPerHour;
minutesPerHour = 60; // error

good practice
another thing about constant variables, is that it is considered good practice to declare them 
with uppercase.

it is not required, but useful for code readability and common for C programmers:

const int BIRTHYEAR = 1980;
