/*Data Types


In C, every piece of data in your program has a specific type. Data types define what kind of data a variable can hold and how much memory it needs. Let's look at the basic data types in C:

Create an integer variable

int age;
This declares a variable named 'age' that can hold whole numbers.

age = 25;
This assigns the value 25 to age. But you can also declare and initialize in one step

int score = 100;
Here are the primary data types in C:

int number = 42;        // Integer (whole number)
float price = 10.5f;    // Floating-point (decimal)
double pi = 3.14159;    // Double precision floating-point
char grade = 'A';       // Single character

Challenge

You are given a program, store in the variable named price the value of 120.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int price = 120;

    return 0;
}
