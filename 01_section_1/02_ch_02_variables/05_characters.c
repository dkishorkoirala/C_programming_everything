/*Characters


In C, the char data type is used to store a single character. Characters in C are enclosed in single quotes.

Declare a character variable:

char letter;
Assign a character to the variable:

letter = 'A';
You can also declare and initialize in one line:

char grade = 'B';
A character occupies 1 byte of memory and is actually stored as an integer representing its ASCII value. For example, 'A' is stored as 65, 'B' as 66, and so on.

You can print a character using the %c format specifier:

printf("The letter is: %c\n", letter);

Challenge

Create a program that:

Declares a character variable named symbol
Assigns the character '@' to this variable
Prints the message "The symbol is: @" where @ is the value of your variable
*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char symbol = '@';
    printf("The symbol is: %c", symbol);
    return 0;
}
